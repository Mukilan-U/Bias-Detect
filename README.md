# Bias Detect Tool 🔍

A simple Streamlit web app that analyzes input text for potential **gender** and **cultural biases** using Google's **Gemini Pro (via Generative AI API)** and suggests **neutral rephrasing**.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects biased language related to gender and culture
- Provides detailed explanations for detected bias
- Suggests neutral rephrasing while preserving original meaning
- Built with:
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
  - [Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro)](https://makersuite.google.com/app)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You enter any piece of text.
2. The app sends the text to Gemini Pro with a prompt for bias analysis.
3. It identifies and explains potentially biased phrases.
4. Then, Gemini is prompted again to suggest rewordings to make the text more neutral.
